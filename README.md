A countdown timer should start from 10 seconds as soon as each new question is presented to the user.
The timer should be visible to the user at all times during the quiz, clearly displaying the remaining time in seconds.

- __Timer Behaviour:__

If the user selects an answer before the 10 seconds expire, the timer should stop immediately.

If the timer reaches zero before the user selects an answer, the question should be automatically marked as incorrect, and the quiz should proceed to the next question.

- __Visual and UX Considerations:__

The timer should be prominently displayed in a way that doesn't obstruct the question or answer choices.

The countdown should be visually distinct and should clearly indicate when time is running out, possibly by changing color or flashing in the final seconds.

- __Scoring and Progress:__

The scoring system should remain consistent, with correct answers being rewarded regardless of how quickly they are selected within the 10-second window.

The quiz should continue to progress smoothly from one question to the next, whether the user answers within the time limit or the timer expires.

- __Edge Cases:__

Ensure that the timer resets correctly for each new question.
